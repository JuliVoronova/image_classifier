# penguins-turtles_classificator
As an example of working with images, I created a classifier of images of penguins and turtles. To solve the problem, I used the LeNet architecture and a pre-trained EfficientNetV2B0 network. With the help of transfer learning anf fine-tuning has upgraded a pre-trained model for the binary classification task.
